<style="font-size:16px;">Yourlandia and Theirlandia have long been involved in a dispute over control of Wave Island:
 <li>According to Theirlandia, its ancestors originally discovered Wave Island nearly 200 years ago, decades before Yourlandia's ancestors first arrived, and Theirlandia has maintained strong cultural ties with the island's inhabitants to this day; Theirlandia considers Wave Island an essential part of its national heritage.</li>
 <li>Yourlandia rejects these claims, asserting that Yourlandia's ancestors discovered Wave Island at the same time that they settled on Sun Island over 200 years ago. Yourlandia claims that both Sun and Wave Islands symbolize their ancestors' bravery in naval exploration, and are therefore essential parts of Yourlandia's national heritage.</li>
<p>

<p>
Theirlandia began the current dispute by demanding that Yourlandia give up control of Wave Island to Theirlandia, threatening to take the island by force if necessary. Theirlandia expresses regret that Yourlandia has ignored Theirlandia's repeated statements of its sovereign rights over Wave Island, and its prior requests that Yourlandia abandon its claim to the island. Theirlandia asserts that it now has no choice but to demand control of Wave Island.
<p>

<p>
Theirlandia further asserts that it does not desire any unnecessary conflict with Yourlandia and that control over Wave Island is the only source of controversy preventing harmonious relations between the two states; Theirlandia looks forward to a mutually beneficial peace once this issue is resolved.
<p>

<p>
Several years ago, Theirlandia had a similar territorial dispute with another state, "Otherlandia." Otherlandia made concessions, and the two states have enjoyed peaceful relations since then.
<p>

<p>
Military experts believe that, in the event of war, the balance of military power between Yourlandia and Theirlandia does not favor either side.
