<style="font-size:16px;"> The conflict takes place in 2025. In that year, the United States is led by Democratic President Linwood Sutter, and Russia is led by President Victor Grishenko, who succeeded Vladimir Putin following his death from a heart attack in 2018. President Grishenko demands that the United States recognize Russia’s annexation of the Svalbard Archipelago in the Arctic Ocean.

</p>

<p>
In the years prior to the conflict, Russia made two claims over Arctic territory:
 
<li>First, Russia petitioned the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) to expand its territorial possessions in the Arctic region. In its petition, Russia claimed a vast 460,000 sq. miles region of seafloor connected to the Lomonosov Ridge as the natural extension of its continental shelf. This territorial claim overlapped with claims made by Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United States. </li>
<li>Second, Russia filed a separate complaint at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) about Norway’s behavior in the Svalbard Archipelago, an Arctic island granted to Norway by the 1920 Svalbard Treaty that lies beyond Russia’s territorial claims. Norway had begun drilling for offshore oil around Svalbard, claiming that the surrounding waters are part of Norwegian national territory. However, Russia argued that Norway was in violation of the Svalbard Treaty, which guarantees equal access to Svalbard’s natural resources for all signatories, and demanded that the ICJ reaffirm Russia’s rights. </li>
</p>

<p>
 After prolonged deliberation, the CLCS and ICJ separately decided both issues:

<li> First, the CLCS conducted a scientific investigation of the Arctic seafloor to determine the extent of Russia’s continental shelf. Scientists found that the Lomonosov Ridge originates from the Russian continental shelf; the CLCS therefore accepted Russia’s petition for sovereignty over additional Arctic territory.</li>
<li> Second, the ICJ rejected Russia’s Svalbard complaint, granting Norway exclusive rights to any offshore oil found in the waters around Svalbard. </li>

 While other international parties (including the U.S.) accepted the rulings, Russia was not satisfied, growing increasingly frustrated with the UN’s decision; Russia would have earned billions of dollars from equal access to Svalbard’s offshore oil. Russian President Grishenko has repeatedly demanded that the UN reconsider its decision, but the UN has declined to do so.

<p><u>Crisis</u>:<br />
<br />
By 2025, tension over Svalbard had escalated into a crisis. President Grishenko announced that Russia would no longer tolerate its illegitimate exclusion from the Arctic region; because the ICJ failed to uphold the Svalbard Treaty, <em>Russia considers the treaty null and void, and demands that Norway cede control over the Svalbard Archipelago</em>.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>President Grishenko warned that Russia would take the archipelago by force if necessary, and would not hesitate to engage with any foreign forces that attempted to interfere. President Grishenko also stated that Russia is only acting to protect its lawful resource rights in the Arctic; Russia has no interest in additional conflict, and expects to enjoy peaceful relations with Norway and other Arctic states once this issue is resolved.</span></span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Theirlandia began the current dispute by demanding that Yourlandia give up control of Wave Island to Theirlandia, threatening to take the island by force if necessary. Theirlandia expresses regret that Yourlandia has ignored Theirlandia's repeated statements of its sovereign rights over Wave Island, and its prior requests that Yourlandia abandon its claim to the island. Theirlandia asserts that it now has no choice but to demand control of Wave Island.
<p>
<p>
Theirlandia further asserts that it does not desire any unnecessary conflict with Yourlandia and that control over Wave Island is the only source of controversy preventing harmonious relations between the two states; Theirlandia looks forward to a mutually beneficial peace once this issue is resolved.
<p>
<p>
Several years ago, Theirlandia had a similar territorial dispute with another state, "Otherlandia." Otherlandia made concessions, and the two states have enjoyed peaceful relations since then.
<p>
<p>
Military experts believe that, in the event of war, the balance of military power between Yourlandia and Theirlandia significantly favors Theirlandia.
